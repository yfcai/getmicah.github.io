      <p>Hi, you reached my homepage, where you will find information related to
      my professional activities.</p>

      <p>I am a researcher and PhD candidate at the
      <a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/">Unversity of Tübingen</a>.
      I like finding pragmatic applications for theories in computer science and
      mathematics. Concretely, I'm using the tools in lambda calculi,
      denotational semantics and type systems to reason about
      <a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/research/ilc/">incremental</a>,
      <a href="http://ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/research/functors/">generic</a>
      and probabilistic programming.</p>

      <p>If there is anything you'd like to know, please do not hesitate to
      <a href="mailto:yufei.yang.cai@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>

    This Scala console application scheduled tutorials for "Informatik 1", a
    400-student lecture at the university of Tübingen. It integrates with the
    lecture's <a href="https://forum-ps.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/">forum</a>
    based on <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>. Students and
    tutors enter their time tables as a forum setting; the teaching staff enter
    the availability of rooms. The software assigns students and tutors to rooms
    and timeslots such that all tutors have similar numbers of students. The
    scheduling problem is then encoded as a minimum-cost-flow instance with edge
    activation constraints, to be solved by
    <a href="http://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a> via
    <a href="https://github.com/vagm/Optimus">Optimus</a>.
